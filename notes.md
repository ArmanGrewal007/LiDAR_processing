LiDAR is acronym for Light Detection and Ranging. It provides very accurate, high resolution 3D data. Captured using special sensors, it results in a set of 3 dimensional points. 
- LiDAR is ideal when very high accuracy measurements are required and is very cost effective for the amount of data generated.
- Airborne LiDAR is becoming more and more popular as a source of terrain mapping due to the high levels of detail it provides.
- Ground-based LiDAR, has began to become more common with off-the-shelf data more prevalent.
- Space-borne LIDAR satellites provide unique information of various parameters in the atmosphere at the global scale.

LiDAR data is captured in two forms namely `discrete return` and `full waveform data`. The data collected by LiDAR sensors need to be processed and analyzed before it can be used for further purposes. 

_This course introduces principles of LiDAR, LiDAR sensors and platforms, LiDAR data view, processing, and analysis, and LiDAR applications. The participants will master basic skills of LiDAR needed to leverage the commercial LiDAR sources and information products in a broad range of applications, including topographic mapping, vegetation characterization, and 3-D modeling of urban infrastructure._
